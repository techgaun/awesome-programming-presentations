> Presentations that programmers should watch

This awesome list documents list of video presentations and conference talks that all programmers would benefit by watching. This list began when I started making habit of watching presentations and talks on weekly basis.

If you are here with bad mood or want to watch fun ones to hear, you should [start here](#fun-to-watch).

If you need some inspiration, [start with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oioj24KQRvM) or listen to [this song](https://soundcloud.com/smixx/smixx-developers-feat-steve) :D
